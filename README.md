# Vocab Saver

A lightweight Chrome extension that auto‑captures words you look up on Google—along with their definitions—into local storage for later review.

## Features

- **Auto‑save**: Instantly grab any word’s definition from Google search results or double‑click text.  
- **De‑duplication**: Won’t save the same word twice.  
- **Quick review**: Open the extension popup to browse, delete, or export your list.  
- **Privacy‑first**: All data stays in your browser; no external servers.

## Installation
